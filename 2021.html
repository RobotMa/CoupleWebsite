            <h1>2nd Year Anniversary</h1>
            <p> It's been a special year since Jun. 16th, 2020 during which the unprecedented global Covid19 pandemic
              dramatically changed people's way of life.
              However, Yifei and Qianli used the opportunity to stay inside home for a long period of time to better
              know each other.
            </p>

            <p> The couple celebrated their big day at Umi restaurant, which they visited for the 1st anniversary as well.
              The two young people also made a big and important decision of their life - to get married. Qianli has
              been
              so attracted to Yifei's inner beauty and outer elegance.
              Yifei has an independent and special attitude towards the ideal way of life for the two of them.
              It's built on the genuine communication between two souls, rather than the framework, tradition or the
              expectation set by the society.
              Qianli really admired this and the two are destined to get onto a life journey that's a bit different from
              the rest of the others.
            </p>

            <p> On December 2021, Yifei and Qianli celebrated their marriage by spending their honeymoon in Puerto Rico
              during the Christmas season.
              Please enjoy the following video to get a glimpse on what it was like to commemorate this important life
              change on an island with different
              culture and customs.
            </p>

            <p> And as always, please stay tuned and wait for more good news to come out!
            </p>
